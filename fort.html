        style=" font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        The first feather on his royal crown, Torna was Shivaji’s premiere conquest at the young age of 16. Having
        rechristened it to Prachandgad, Shivaji Maharaj constructed monuments on its massive spread.</p>
    <h1>2.Sinhagad</h1>
    <img src="./imagesp/Sinhagad_034a7f851d.png" alt="sinhagad" height="500" width="500">
        <P
        style="font-family:Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ;">
        After scaling a steep cliff and fighting a brutal battle against the Mughals, Tanaji Malusare lost his life. His
        brother took charge and won over the fort. Grieving this loss, Shivaji Maharaj remorsefully said, “Gad aala, pan
        Sinha gela” – We won the fort, but lost the lion. This explains the name and its importance in the pages of
        Maratha history.

    </P>
    <h1>3.Raigad</h1>
    <img src="./imagesp/Raigad_6a66196fb3.png" alt="raigad" height="500" width="500">

    <P style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        An epoch-making fort in the history of Maharashtra, Raigad was the capital of the Maratha Empire. It was here
        that the royal coronation of Shivaji Maharaj as the official king of the Maratha Empire took place. Although the
        fort was purloined and wrecked by the Britishers in 1818, much of its glory still remains. Shivaji Maharaj
        breathed his last in this fort.
    </P>
    <h1>4.Shivneri</h1>
    <img src="./imagesp/Shivneri_113640629e.png" alt="shivneri" height="500" width="500">

    <P style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        A 17th century fort, Shivneri is the birthplace of Shivaji Maharaj. The fort carries small temple of Goddess
        Shivai Devi after whom he was named.
    </P>
    <h1>5.Vijaydurg</h1>
    <img src="./imagesp/Vijaydurg_cd17db3ed3.png" alt="vijaydurg" height="500" width="500">

    <P style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        A beautiful and an impregnable sea fort, Vijaydurg is considered one of Shivaji’s best victories. Used as an
        anchor for Maratha warships, Vijaydurg is encircled by the Waghotan creek.
    </P>
    <h1>6.Sindudurg</h1>
    <img src="./imagesp/Sindhudurg_abd4403994.png" alt="sindhudurg" height="500" width="500">

    <P style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        Once a powerful naval base for the Maratha Kingdom, this sea fort now remains a beautiful history. It
        impregnates the only temple dedicated to Shivaji Maharaj and also preserves his footprints. It is a popular
        tourist destination and ferries are available to reach this place.
    </P>
    <h1>7.Rajgad</h1>
    <img src="./imagesp/Rajgad_fb135a8d0c.png" alt="rajgad" height="500" width="500">

    <P style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        The erstwhile capital of the Maratha Empire, Shivaji Maharaj made many commandments and led history-defining
        moments from here. He spent almost 26 years of his life here. The fort has seen many epoch-making events like
        the burial of Afzal Khan's head, the birth of Shivaji's son Rajaram, the death of Shivaji's Queen Saibai, and
        the return of Shivaji from Agra.
    </P>
    <h1>8.Pratapgad</h1>
    <img src="./imagesp/Pratapgad_3262f773e8.png" alt="pratapgad" height="500" width="500">

    <P style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        Pratapgad is famous for the encounter between Shivaji and the mighty Afzal Khan. It was here that Shivaji’s true
        reign began after he defeated Afzal Khan, making this fort one of the most important events in the Maratha
        history.
    </P>
    <h1>9.Lohagad</h1>
    <img src="./imagesp/Lohagad_474821605f.png" alt="lohagad" height="500" width="500">

    <P style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        Having conquered this fort twice by Shivaji Maharaj, Lohagad held its prime importance due to its strategic
        location. The trade route to Khandala was guarded against here.
